TOP | HOW DOES THE WEB WORK?
---------------------

Q: What is a network?

Q: What is the internet?
A: It is an Infrastructure - Network of computers connected which allow the transfer of data

Q: What is an IP address?
A: Internet Protocol - A Unique string of numbers identifying your device address on the internet / local network - They help computers find each other

Q: What is a router?
A: Router is small device which makes sure the sent / received data (packets) reaches the correct location / destination

Q: What is an ISP?
A: Internet Service Provider e.g Virgin / Talktalk - They manage special routers that are all linked together and can also access other ISPs.

Q: What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?
A: Packets can be any form of data which are broken down into pieces (zeros and ones) which individually make way to the requested destination and reassemble to form the complete data - this allows the client to slowly load the data being received instead of waiting longer for the complete data.

Q: What is a client?
A: Client is the device requesting/receiving data/file form the server (Personal / Work - Computers / Phones)

Q: What is a server?
A: Super computer which stores multiple websites / apps (programs) - They are connected directly to the internet

A: Web browser is a piece of software that retrieves and displays web pages

Q: What is a search engine?
A: A Web service which helps you find other web pages e.g google, bing and yahoo

Q: What is a DNS request?
A: Domain Name System - DNS Request is when the client makes a request by accessing the DNS server which acts as the internet phonebook 

Q: Which browser are you currently using?
A: Google Chrome / Safari and occasionally firefox

Q: In your own words, explain what happens when you run a search on google.com.
A1: An IP request is made which goes through my ISP cables to a router that directs the request to the correct server which handles the request 
A2: The google site / file is broken into pieces called packets that are sent back to my IP address - independently the packets navigate to my IP utilising the routers and once they reach my IP they begin reassembling back to the complete file.

A: Git saves the updates made and keeps record of each saved point while a text editor saves the current file as it is and doesn't allow reverting back to previous saved points.

Q: Does Git work at a local or remote level?
A: Git works on both local and remote level - git saves locally and allows the data to be pushed online once access to the internet is established.

Q: Does GitHub work at a local or remote level?
A: Github works on a remote level as it is a website and can only be accessed via the internet.

Q: Why is Git useful for an individual developer?
A: Git is useful for individual developers because it allows them to recall previous version of the same file instead of saving multiple variations of the same file.

---------------------
FUNDAMENTALS PART 1
---------------------

Q: Name the three ways to declare a variable?
A: The three ways to declare a variable is by using var, let and const.

Q: Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
A: You should avoid using the 'var' declaration because it is less error prone also functions similarly to let

Q: What rules should you follow when naming variables?
A: Only use letters, numbers and symbols, don't start name with a number or a capital letter and follow the camelCase approach

Q: What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?
A: The operator + functions differently with number and strings - it merges (concatenates) them

Q: How does the % operator work?
A: The % works as a remainder operator e.g 5%2 = 1 

Q: Explain the difference between == and ===.
A: == equals to and === equals value and type (string / number) - 5 == '5'// true | 5 === '5' // false

Q: What are the falsy values in JavaScript?
A: A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all become false. 

Q: What are conditionals?
A: Conditions are statements which evaluate particular parameters and execute if return true
- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

Q: What are the advantages of breaking a problem down and solving the smaller problems?
A: It is less over whelming and easier to solve, It also works well with the function approach (each function should do a single task)

---------------------
UNDERSTANDING ERRORS
---------------------

Q: What are three reasons why you may see a TypeError?
A: Argument passed to a function is incompatible with the  type expected by that operator, attempting to modify a value that cannot be changed or attempting to use a value in an inappropriate way. 

Q: What is the key difference between an error and a warning?

Q: What is one method you can use to resolve an error?
A: Use console.log facilitate the debugging process

---------------------
CLEAN CODE
---------------------

Q: Why is it important to write clean code?
A: It makes it easier to maintain/update/read the code by the developer at a later date or their colleagues

Q: Name 5 clean code principles previously mentioned
A 1: Use comments to explain 'why' the code does what it does,
  2: Properly format structure to allow the ease of reading and updating,
  3: Avoid extremely large functions because it can get confusing and its better practice to break it up into smaller functions
  4: Write down the logic before coding as it helps to better understand the program and whats required
  5: Use naming standards for functions and variables as it makes it clear what they do or being used for which inturn makes your code manageable 


Q: What is the difference between good comments and bad comments?
A: Good comments explain the code and assist during moments of doubt and bad comments repeat what the code does or portray information that does not assist with understanding the code

---------------------

A: By using the javascript remove method 

Q: How can you alter an element in the DOM?
A: You can alter an element in the DOM by using its reference

Q: When adding text to a DOM element, should you use textContent or innerHTML? Why?
A: Use textContent as innerHTML will override existing html and text instead of just the text
A: By using innerHTML it could possibly open you code/program to attacks/hackers

Q: Where should you include your JavaScript tag in your HTML file when working with DOM nodes?
A: Before for closing body tag as that allows the html elements to parse or within the head tag with the "defer" attribute added for it to wait until the html elements  have parsed.

Q: How do “events” and “listeners” work?
A: Eventlistner wait for an event(click, hover or keydown) to happen before triggering and executing a code

Q: What are three ways to use events in your code?
A: Eventlistner can be added using inline onclick attribute, external onclick function or by adding the Eventlistner function.

Q: Why are event listeners the preferred way to handle events?
A: Its clearner way to code and it also allows you to add multiple events which makes it more flexible and powerful

Q: What are the benefits of using named functions in your listeners?
A: It keeps your code clean and make it easier if the function is needed in multiple sections/elements

Q: How do you attach listeners to groups of nodes?
A: To add listners to multiple elements you would need to iterate through each element and add by using (forEach) function

Q: What is the difference between the return values of querySelector and querySelectorAll?
A: querySelector returns the first element that matches the selector whereas the querySelectorAll returns a nodelist of all the elements that match the selector

Q: What does a “nodelist” contain?
A: It contains a list of elements and within each element attributes which can be utilized 

Q: Explain the difference between “capture” and “bubbling”.
A: Capturing is the event traveling inwards e.g body > parent > clicked element into the element clicked and bubble is when the event travels outward e.g clicked element > parent > body
