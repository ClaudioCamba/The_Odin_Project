TOP | HOW DOES THE WEB WORK?
---------------------

Q: What is a network?

Q: What are packets and how are they used to transfer data?
A: Packets can be any form of data which are broken down into pieces (zeros and ones) which individually make way to the requested destination and reassemble to form the complete data - this allows the client to slowly load the data being received instead of waiting longer for the complete data.

Q: What is a client?

A: Domain Name System - DNS Request is when the client makes a request by accessing the DNS server which acts as the internet phonebook 

Q: Which browser are you currently using?
A: Google Chrome / Safari and occasionally firefox

Q: In your own words, explain what happens when you run a search on google.com.
A1: An IP request is made which goes through my ISP cables to a router that directs the request to the correct server which handles the request 
A2: The google site / file is broken into pieces called packets that are sent back to my IP address - independently the packets navigate to my IP utilising the routers and once they reach my IP they begin reassembling back to the complete file.

A: Git saves the updates made and keeps record of each saved point while a text editor saves the current file as it is and doesn't allow reverting back to previous saved points.

Q: Does Git work at a local or remote level?
A: Git works on both local and remote level - git saves locally and allows the data to be pushed online once access to the internet is established.

Q: Does GitHub work at a local or remote level?
A: Github works on a remote level as it is a website and can only be accessed via the internet.

---------------------
FUNDAMENTALS PART 1
---------------------

Q: Name the three ways to declare a variable?
A: The three ways to declare a variable is by using var, let and const.

Q: Which of the three variable declarations should you avoid and why?
A: You should avoid using the 'var' declaration because it is less error prone also functions similarly to let

Q: What rules should you follow when naming variables?
A: Only use letters, numbers and symbols, don't start name with a number or a capital letter and follow the camelCase approach

Q: What should you look out for when using the + operator with numbers and strings?
A: The operator + functions differently with number and strings - it merges (concatenates) them

Q: How does the % operator work?
A: The % works as a remainder operator e.g 5%2 = 1 

Q: Explain the difference between == and ===.
A: == equals to and === equals value and type (string / number) - 5 == '5'// true | 5 === '5' // false

A: When trying to do arithmetic with a non-numeric string

Q: How do you increment and decrement a number?
A: '++' is used to increment and '--' is used to decrement

Q: Explain the difference between prefixing and post-fixing increment/decrement operators.
A: prefix is when the operator is before the variable and postfix is when it's after

Q: What is operator precedence and how is it handled in JS?
A: Every operator has a corresponding precedence number. The one with the larger number executes first. If the precedence is the same, the execution order is from left to right.

Q: How do you escape characters in a string?
A: By adding a backslash before the character

Q: What is the difference between the slice/substring/substr string methods?
A: slice - accepts negative values and extracts values between the 2 parameter index / substring - doesn't accept negative values / substr - the second parameter specifies the length of the extracted part

Q: What are the falsy values in JavaScript?
A: A number 0, an empty string "", null, undefined, and NaN all become false. 

Q: What are conditionals?
A: Conditions are statements which evaluate particular parameters and execute if return true
- Use if to specify a block of code to be executed, if a specified condition is true
- Use else to specify a block of code to be executed, if the same condition is false
- Use else if to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false
- Use switch to specify many alternative blocks of code to be executed

Q: What is the syntax for an if/else conditional?
A: if (condition) { 
        code if true 
    } else {
